Innovations in technology, such as advancements in laser treatment and radiofrequency applications, have expanded the scope of aesthetic treatments available. In 2024, the market size is expected to reach <strong>$12 billion</strong>, reflecting a robust growth trajectory fueled by factors such as an aging population, rising disposable incomes, and heightened awareness about personal aesthetics.</p> <p>From 2024 to 2032, this market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of <strong>8.5%</strong>, reaching an estimated market size of <strong>$25 billion</strong> by the end of the forecast period. The increasing acceptance of aesthetically pleasing appearances and a growing emphasis on self-image are contributing to this growth. In particular, the adoption of technologies such as infrared and ultrasound treatments is becoming commonplace, as consumers seek effective and less invasive alternatives to surgical options.</p> <p>Additionally, the energy-based aesthetic treatments market is becoming increasingly diverse, with new products and services entering the market.
