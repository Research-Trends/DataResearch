With their lightweight properties, UV resistance, and superior optical clarity, acrylic sheets are increasingly preferred over glass in various settings. The market size for acrylic sheets was estimated at USD 4.5 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow steadily in the upcoming years.</p><p>Between 2024 and 2032, the acrylic sheets market is anticipated to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 5.2%. This growth can be attributed to rising demand in the construction sector, particularly for windows, skylights, and signage. Additionally, the trend towards sustainable materials is propelling the use of acrylic sheets, as they are more versatile and easier to manufacture than traditional materials.</p><p>As we look towards the future, the market is expected to reach a value of USD 6.7 billion by 2032.
